## Tasks

### ‚úÖ Task 1: Calculate Factorial Using a Function

**Description:**  
A Python script that:
1. Defines a function named `factorial` that calculates the factorial of a number using a loop or recursion.
2. Returns the calculated factorial.
3. Calls the function with a sample number and prints the result.

**Sample Output:**
```
Enter a number: 5
Factorial of 5 is 120
```

### ‚úÖ Task 2: Using the Math Module for Calculations

**Description:**  
A Python script that:
1. Takes a number input from the user.
2. Uses the `math` module to compute:
   - Square root
   - Natural logarithm (log base e)
   - Sine (in radians)
3. Displays the results clearly.

**Sample Output:**
```
Enter a number: 25
Square root: 5.0
Natural logarithm: 3.2188758248682006
Sine (in radians): -0.13235175009777303
```

## How to Run the Programs

1. Make sure Python 3 is installed on your system.
2. Download or clone this repository.
3. Run the scripts using your terminal or IDE:

```bash
python assignment3_task1.py
python assignment3_task2.py
```

The `math` module is a built-in module in Python and does not require separate installation.
